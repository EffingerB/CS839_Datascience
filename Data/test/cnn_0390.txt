Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- <n>Raymond Davis<\n>, the American accused of killing two Pakistani men, appeared Friday in a Pakistani court, where he was handed documents that detailed the case against him.

The court then adjourned until March 3 when <n>Davis<\n> is expected to be formally charged.

The case has strained relations between the United States and Pakistan, a key ally in the war against al Qaeda and the Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan, and the shooting deaths have outraged many Pakistanis.

Meanwhile, Pakistani authorities have detained a second U.S. citizen, identified as <n>Aaron Mark DeHaven<\n>, in Peshawar, according to a statement Friday by the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad.

No additional details can be confirmed until a U.S. government representative meets with <n>DeHaven<\n>, the statement said.

<n>Davis<\n> has said that the January 27 shooting occurred after two men attacked him as he drove through a busy Lahore neighborhood, according to the U.S. Embassy.

U.S. officials originally said <n>Davis<\n> was a diplomat and later revealed he is a CIA contractor, intensifying the already highly charged situation.

During the court hearing Friday, <n>Davis<\n> was handed over documents of evidence in the case, but he initially refused to accept them because they were in Urdu, a language he did not understand.

Clerks were told to translate the documents into English. <n>Davis<\n> told the judge that he should be released from jail because he has diplomatic immunity, the same argument other U.S. officials have used since <n>Davis<\n>' arrest.

The judge said he was waiting on a response from the Pakistani government on that issue and that it should happen at the March hearing.
