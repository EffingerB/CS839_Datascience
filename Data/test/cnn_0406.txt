Holding a shotgun and shooting skeet, the Democratic candidate out to topple Senate Republican leader <n>Mitch McConnell<\n> attempts to flip the script in a new television ad.

The ad shows <n>Alison Lundergan Grimes<\n> blasting away, then pops in a picture of <n>McConnell<\n> brandishing a gun upside down over his head at the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this year.

"<n>Mitch<\n>, that's not how you hold a gun," <n>Grimes<\n> says.

<n>Grimes<\n> is not <n>Barack Obama<\n>, she says, no matter what <n>McConnell<\n> "wants you to think."

"<n>Mitch<\n> was the same guy who thought Duke basketball players were UK."

That reference is to a <n>McConnell<\n> campaign ad that mistakenly placed video of Duke University's basketball team celebrating a 2010 NCAA championship win instead of the Kentucky Wildcats' 2012 win.

<n>McConnell<\n> has painted a vote for <n>Grimes<\n> as a vote for <n>Obama<\n>, and a CNN/ORC poll from earlier this month showed about two-thirds of Kentucky voters harbor an unfavorable view of the President. <n>McConnell<\n>'s pitch is that the only way to alter the balance of power in Washington is through a GOP Senate takeover on Election Day that would put him in charge -- if he can beat <n>Grimes<\n>, who would be Kentucky's first woman senator.

<n>Grimes<\n> says in the new ad that <n>McConnell<\n> is "attacking me on coal after doing nothing while we've lost thousands of coal jobs."

<n>McConnell<\n> has vowed to roll back <n>Obama<\n> regulations that Republicans loathe, especially Environmental Protection Agency rules on coal that Kentuckians see as harmful to their coal-rich economy.

"He even said it's not his job to bring jobs to Kentucky," she says in the ad before firing another shot.

"I'm not <n>Barack Obama<\n>," she says, "I disagree with him on guns, coal and the EPA.

The ad is reminiscent of then-West Virginia Senate candidate <n>Joe Manchin<\n>'s 2010 TV ad that showed him shooting a cap and trade bill with a rifle. His GOP opponent had painted him as a surrogate for <n>Obama<\n>. The Senate Democrat went on to win.
