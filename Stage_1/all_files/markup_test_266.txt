(CNN) -- For the second time in as many years -- after going 46 years with the same coach, <n>Joe Paterno<\n> -- Penn State has named a new man to helm its storied football program.

<n>James Franklin<\n>, 41, was announced Saturday as the Nittany Lions' next football coach, replacing <n>Bill O'Brien<\n>, who was hired in January 2012 and recently left to become head coach of the NFL's Houston Texans.

"I'm excited to come home," said <n>Franklin<\n>, who had led Vanderbilt University's football team the last three years but originally hails from Langhorne, Pennsylvania. "I'm a Pennsylvania boy with a Penn State heart."

A former assistant coach at the University of Maryland and Kansas State University, <n>Franklin<\n> took over a Vanderbilt team that went 2-10 in 2010 and led them to a 24-15 record and three straight bowl appearances.

<n>Franklin<\n> joins a program that is still rocked, in many ways, by fallout from the child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach <n>Jerry Sandusky<\n>.

In addition to leading to <n>Sandusky<\n>'s conviction on 45 counts involving 10 young victims, the ordeal led to cover-up allegations and criminal charges involving three former Penn State administrators, including one-time President <n>Graham Spanier<\n>.

And as the scandal was first unfolding, <n>Paterno<\n> was ousted as the football team's coach. He died a short time later.

The NCAA imposed harsh sanctions on Penn State in the wake of what happened, including scholarship reductions, a post-season ban, a $60-million fine and 13 years of vacated wins.

The Nittany Lions' team nonetheless surprised many with its performance under <n>O'Brien<\n>, finishing 8-4 in 2012 and 7-5 this season. But there remained a perception that <n>Paterno<\n> supporters weren't fully supportive of the new coach, with reports that sentiment played some part in <n>O'Brien<\n>'s exit.

<n>Paterno<\n>'s widow, <n>Sue<\n>, released a statement Saturday welcoming <n>Franklin<\n> -- who described the late coach as the "great <n>Joe Paterno<\n>" during Saturday's press conference.

"His deep ties to Pennsylvania and his exceptional coaching record have prepared him well for his new position," <n>Sue Paterno<\n> said. "We wish Coach <n>Franklin<\n> great success and we know he will find broad support and encouragement from Penn Staters everywhere."

The university's outgoing president, <n>Rodney Erickson<\n>, said <n>Franklin<\n>'s hire followed what he called "a careful and deliberate search process."

"Our program requires a very special kind of leader," <n>Erickson<\n> said of the dual commitment for excellence on the field, the classroom and in the community. "...I believe we have found the right person."
