U.S. Surgeon General <n>Regina Benjamin<\n> announced late Wednesday that she will step down next month after four years in the post.

<n>Benjamin<\n>, a longtime advocate for a health care model centered on wellness and preventive treatment, announced her decision in an e-mail to staff, thanking them for supporting her vision.

"My goal was to create a grassroots movement, to change our health care system from one focused on sickness and disease to a system focused on wellness and prevention. With your help, that movement has begun," <n>Benjamin<\n> wrote.

In an e-mail to staff, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services <n>Kathleen Sebelius<\n> said <n>Benjamin<\n> should be "proud of her many achievements."

"<n>Regina<\n> has served as America's doctor since 2009 and has impacted the health and lives of Americans across the country. I am deeply grateful for her leadership and service," <n>Sebelius<\n> wrote. "The Surgeon General's road to prevention has touched the lives of millions of Americans and has had a positive impact on the health of this Nation."

As surgeon general, <n>Benjamin<\n> chaired the National Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health Council, which was created under the Affordable Care Act to develop a strategy to improve access to care.

"<n>Regina<\n> has been passionate about changing our health care system from one focused on sickness and disease to a system focused on wellness and prevention," <n>Sebelius<\n> said.

Prior to her nomination, <n>Benjamin<\n> served as CEO of the Bayou La Batre Rural Health Clinic in Alabama, which she founded in 1990.

The Alabama native was also the first African-American woman board member of the American Medical Association, and served a term as chairwoman of the group's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs.

Deputy Surgeon General  <n>Boris D. Lushniak<\n> will serve as interim surgeon general until a permanent pick is nominated.
