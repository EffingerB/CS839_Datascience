(CNN) -- <n>Shahid Afridi<\n> claimed six victims to pave the way for Pakistan to claim victory by four wickets in their opening one-day international against Australia in Dubai.

Career-best figures from <n>Shahid Afridi<\n> helped steer Pakistan to victory in the first one-dayer against Australia.

The all-rounder secured career-best figures of six for 38 as Australia could only manage a paltry 168 in an innings that lasted just 38.5 overs.

The world champions again lost their way in the middle overs, losing eight for 27 at one stage as they wilted against <n>Afridi<\n>'s spin.

It could have been worse for the Australians who relied on a last-wicket stand of 46 runs between <n>James Hopes<\n> (48 not out) and <n>Ben Hilfenhaus<\n> (four) to give their score some respectability.

Pakistan's reply always looked on track with <n>Kamran Akmal<\n> hitting 48 at the top of the order before <n>Misbah-ul-Haq<\n> anchored the innings with an unbeaten 30 from 68 balls.

A near-capacity crowd filled the Dubai Sports City Cricket Stadium as the venue hosted international cricket for the first time.

The postponed series, which was originally due to be played last year, had been moved from Pakistan to neutral turf because of security concerns.

Meanwhile, a superb half-century from <n>Adam Gilchrist<\n> set Deccan Chargers on their way to a 24-run win over Bangalore Royal Challengers in the Indian Premier League in Cape Town.

The Australian smashed a quickfire 71 and <n>Rohit Sharma<\n> contributed 52 as Deccan reached 184 for six from their 20 overs.

Bangalore's reply never really got going with captain <n>Kevin Pietersen<\n> managing just 11 before he fell to a teasing delivery from <n>Pragyan Ojha<\n> and a smart stumping from <n>Gilchrist<\n>.

<n>Rahul Dravid<\n> gave them hope with a thumping 48 before holing out, and <n>Virat Kohli<\n> posted 50, but with precious little support from their team-mates their efforts proved in vain.
