(CNN) -- After 26 years, <n>Tawana Brawley<\n> has finally begun paying damages to <n>Steven Pagones<\n>, a man she falsely accused of being among a group of men who raped her in 1987.

<n>Brawley<\n>'s payment comes in the form of nearly $3,800 in wage garnishments, <n>Pagones<\n> told CNN Sunday. <n>Brawley<\n> still owes <n>Pagones<\n> more than $400,000 in defamation damages.

In fall 1987, <n>Brawley<\n>, who is African-American, was found disheveled inside a trash bag with racial slurs written across her body in Wappingers Falls, New York. <n>Brawley<\n>, then 15, claimed she was kidnapped and repeatedly raped by a group of white men.

In one of his first mainstream cases, activist <n>Al Sharpton<\n> became <n>Brawley<\n>'s spokesman, staging rallies and calling for justice on her behalf.

When the case was brought before a grand jury, it concluded that <n>Brawley<\n> had falsified the entire account.

<n>Pagones<\n>, who was an assistant district attorney, filed a civil suit that named <n>Brawley<\n>, <n>Sharpton<\n> and <n>Brawley<\n>'s lawyers as defendants.

<n>Sharpton<\n> has since paid his debt to <n>Pagones<\n>. But <n>Brawley<\n>, now 41 and a nurse living in Virginia, still owes <n>Pagones<\n> more than $431,000.

<n>Pagones<\n> says he will forgive the debt if <n>Brawley<\n> issues a personal apology and finally clears his name of all wrongdoing.

"Just tell the truth. That's all I'm looking for here. I have been battling this since day one, and it's really all about telling the truth," <n>Pagones<\n> said.

Calls to <n>Brawley<\n> were not returned.
