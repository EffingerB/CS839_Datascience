(CNN) -- The feat has not been achieved since 1936 but with every victory, the pressure on <n>Andy Murray<\n> to deliver a first British winner of the men's singles at Wimbledon since <n>Fred Perry<\n> grows.

The expectation is always there for any leading British player but with <n>Rafael Nadal<\n> and <n>Roger Federer<\n> having unexpectedly dropped out of his section of the draw, <n>Murray<\n> is fancied like never before to finally rewrite history.

The beaten finalist in 2012, the 26-year-old survived a second set scare to beat Russian 20th seed <n>Mikhail Youzhny<\n> 6-4 7-5 (7-5) 6-1 and reach the quarterfinals for the sixth straight year.

The second seed will meet the unseeded <n>Fernando Verdasco<\n> for a place in the semifinals, with the Scot boasting an 8-1 winning record against the Spaniard, who beat <n>Kenny de Schepper<\n> in straight sets.

"It was a tough match," U.S. Open and Olympic champion <n>Murray<\n> said later. "The first couple of sets especially -- and he also had a chance at the start of the third.

"But once I got ahead in the third set, I concentrated really hard not to let him back into the match like I did in the second set."

The turning point of a contest that lasted two hours and 37 minutes came in the second set when <n>Murray<\n> managed to turn around a 2-5 deficit to win on a tie break.

<n>Youzhny<\n> needed treatment on a shoulder injury early in the third set and faded soon after, so allowing the British number one to reach the last eight without dropping a set.

"I just have to concentrate on the next match," he said when asked about the pressure of being the home favorite.

"<n>Serena Williams<\n> lost today and she doesn't lose particularly often," he explained. "<n>Roger<\n> lost, <n>Rafa<\n> lost -- all these guys and girls are better than me and if they can lose, so can I."

Should <n>Murray<\n> come through his quarterfinal, he will meet either <n>Jerzy Janowicz<\n> or <n>Lukasz Kubot<\n> in the last four -- with one of the Polish duo set to create history.

Whoever wins their clash will become the first Pole to reach the semifinals of a men's grand slam.

The <n>Radwanska<\n> sisters may have put Polish tennis on the map in recent years but they have long been hoping that they will be joined by their male compatriots.

Without a quarterfinalist at Wimbledon since 1980, two came along on the same day as 24th seed <n>Janowicz<\n>, 22, beat Austria's <n>Jurgen Melzer<\n> in five sets while the unseeded <n>Kubot<\n> was also taken all the way when beating <n>Adrian Mannarino<\n>.

Despite the significance of their forthcoming encounter, <n>Janowicz<\n> and <n>Kubot<\n>, 31, hugged one another as soon as they met in the locker room after their respective wins.

"It's unbelievable what is going on right now," the big-serving <n>Janowicz<\n> told reporters. "We have two players in the quarterfinals in the men's draw.

"Right now, tennis is a really famous sport in our country. I hope we'll get more fans."

<n>Kubot<\n>'s passage to the quarterfinals was first eased by the shock defeat of <n>Rafael Nadal<\n> in the opening round and then further helped as the Spaniard's conqueror <n>Steve Darcis<\n> was forced to pull out of his second round meeting with the Pole through injury.

In the top half of the draw, <n>David Ferrer<\n> -- who lost his first grand slam final against compatriot Nadal at the French Open last month -- reached his second straight Wimbledon quarterfinal when beating Croatia's Ivan Dodig 6-7 7-6 6-1 6-1.

"I'm trying to play more aggressive," said <n>Ferrer<\n>, who has never progressed to the last four at Wimbledon. "I need to serve better than other courts, obviously when I am playing the second shot. Every match I am playing better with my game. I am confident."

Next up for the consistent Spaniard, who will rise to a career-high world No. 3 in next week's rankings, is Argentina's <n>Juan Martin del Potro<\n>, who beat 23rd seed <n>Andreas Seppi<\n> in straight sets.

"He's a very great player," said <n>Ferrer<\n>. "It's going to be difficult. I need to play my best tennis to beat <n>Del Potro<\n>. And on a grass court I think it is more difficult. He plays better than me on grass. Last year I beat him, but I think I played my best match on a grass court."

Whoever wins through will meet either <n>Novak Djokovic<\n>, who beat <n>Tommy Haas<\n> in straight sets late on Monday, or <n>Tomas Berdych<\n>, who sunk <n>Bernard Tomic<\n> 7-6 6-7 6-4 6-4, in the last four.
