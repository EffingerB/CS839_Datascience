HBO is backing a documentary based on "Going Clear," a book about Scientology and Hollywood -- and isn't taking any chances with the legal side of things.

"We have probably 160 lawyers" looking at the film, HBO Documentary Films President <n>Sheila Nevins<\n> told The Hollywood Reporter. (HBO, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.)

"Going Clear," by Pulitzer Prize-winning writer <n>Lawrence Wright<\n> ("The Looming Tower"), digs into the life of Scientology founder <n>L. Ron Hubbard<\n> and the influence his church has had on its believers, many of whom have close ties to Hollywood.

Among Tinseltown's famous Scientologists are <n>John Travolta<\n> and <n>Tom Cruise<\n>.

Some of <n>Wright<\n>'s findings, including claims of abuse, didn't go over well with the church.

"The stories of alleged physical abuse are lies concocted by a small group of self-corroborating confessed liars. The hard evidence clearly shows that no such conduct ever occurred and that in fact there is evidence that shows it did NOT occur," the group's spokeswoman, <n>Karin Pouw<\n>, told CNN's <n>Miguel Marquez<\n> in 2013.

The documentary is being directed by <n>Alex Gibney<\n>, who won an Oscar for 2007's "Taxi to the Dark Side."

HBO expects to air the documentary in 2015.
