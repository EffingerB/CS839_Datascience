A 14-year-old boy is being hailed as a hero in Pakistan for tackling a suicide bomber -- dying at the main gate of his school and saving schoolmates gathered for their morning assembly.

Ninth-grader <n>Aitazaz Hassan Bangash<\n> was on his way to the Ibrahimzai School on Monday in the Hangu district of northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when the bomber, dressed in a school uniform, asked him where the school was, the teen's cousin told CNN.

<n>Aitazaz<\n> and his cousin, <n>Musadiq Ali Bangash<\n>, became suspicious, <n>Musadiq<\n> said.

"The other students backed off, but <n>Aitazaz<\n> challenged the bomber and tried to catch him. During the scuffle, the bomber panicked and detonated his bomb," he said.

<n>Rajab Ali<\n>, who also witnessed the bombing, told CNN that he saw <n>Aitazaz<\n> throw a large stone at a boy trying to enter the school. The blast happened when <n>Aitazaz<\n> grabbed him, he said.

<n>Aitazaz<\n> and the bomber died at the scene. Witnesses say the blast injured two other people.

<n>Iftikhar Ahmed<\n>, a Hangu district police officer, confirmed the details of the attack to CNN.

Hangu is a troubled district bordering Pakistan's tribal areas. It is rife with sectarian violence, with attacks against Shia and Sunni Muslims.

"It was a great sacrifice to save the lives of hundreds of both Shia and Sunni students, who were in morning assembly," <n>Musadiq<\n> said.

<n>Aitazaz<\n> is survived by his father, <n>Mujaad Ali Bangash<\n>, a laborer; his elder brother, <n>Mustajab Hassan Bangash<\n>, a student in Pakistan; and three sisters.

Local residents such as <n>Nawaz Khan<\n> are calling for <n>Aitazaz<\n> to receive a posthumous award for his bravery. "He saved the lives of hundreds of students. He deserves more recognition than <n>Malala Yousafzai<\n>," he said.

Pakistanis are comparing him to <n>Malala<\n>, the schoolgirl shot by the Taliban in October 2012 for promoting education for all boys and girls.

Pakistanis on social media are praising <n>Aitazaz<\n>'s bravery, with people on Twitter asking everyone to use hastags #onemillionaitzazs or simply #aitzaz and calling for his heroism to be recognized with an award.
