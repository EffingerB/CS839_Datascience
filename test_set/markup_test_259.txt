Comedian <n>David Brenner<\n>, a regular on <n>Johnny Carson<\n>'s "The Tonight Show," has died after a battle with cancer, a family spokesman said Saturday. He was 78.

<n>Brenner<\n> was a staple on <n>Carson<\n>'s late-night show, appearing more times than any other guest -- 158, according to a bio on his official website.

Before getting into comedy, <n>Brenner<\n> helped write, produce and direct 115 TV documentaries, earning him nearly 30 awards.

<n>Brenner<\n> also was the author of five books -- his latest published in 2003, "I Think There's a Terrorist in My Soup."

Even in death, he kept the jokes coming. <n>Brenner<\n>'s final request, according to family spokesman <n>Jeff Abraham<\n>, was to have $100 in small bills tucked in his sock -- "just in case tipping is recommended where I'm going."

His gravesite will read: "If this is supposed to be a joke -- then I don't get it!," according to <n>Abraham<\n>.

Comedian <n>Joan Rivers<\n>, a longtime friend of <n>Brenner<\n>'s, tweeted about the news of his passing Saturday.

"RIP <n>David Brenner<\n>. I adored him, and laughed more with him than anybody. Sad, sad, sad. Knowing David, he's now making the devil laugh," read <n>Rivers<\n>' tweet.

<n>Brenner<\n> is survived by his wife, three sons and a grandson.
