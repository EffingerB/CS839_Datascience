(CNN)<n>Debra Milke<\n> spent 22 years on death row, convicted of conspiring with two other men to kill her son allegedly for an insurance payout.

On Monday, a judge ruled that the Arizona woman is innocent and dismissed all charges against her.

This makes <n>Milke<\n> only the second woman exonerated from death row in the United States.

More importantly, the judge's decision finally clears <n>Milke<\n> after years of legal back-and-forth in a case where she steadfastly maintained her innocence.

Key to the case's dismissal was prosecutorial misconduct, mainly that of a detective, <n>Armando Saldate<\n>, who said <n>Milke<\n> confessed to the crime to him -- even though there was no witness or recording.

Prosecutors withheld from the jury <n>Saldate<\n>'s personnel record which showed instances of misconduct in other cases, including lying under oath.

The two men with whom <n>Milke<\n> was accused of conspiring were tried separately and are still on death row.

A day after seeing <n>Santa Claus<\n> at a mall on December 1, 1989, young <n>Christopher Milke<\n> asked his mother if he could go again.

<n>Milke<\n>'s roomate, <n>James Styers<\n>, took the boy; then called <n>Milke<\n> saying <n>Christopher<\n> had disappeared.

Instead, <n>Styers<\n> and a friend drove the boy out of town to a secluded ravine where <n>Styers<\n> shot <n>Christopher<\n> three times in the head, prosecutors said.

<n>Styers<\n> and the friend were convicted of murder and sentenced to death.

<n>Milke<\n> was implicated based on alleged testimony from <n>Styers<\n>'s friend, <n>Roger Scott<\n>.

The detective, <n>Saldate<\n>, said <n>Scott<\n> told him that <n>Milke<\n> was involved in a plot to kill her son. And during her trial, prosecutors floated a likely motive: A $5,000 life insurance policy she had taken out on the child.

But neither <n>Scott<\n> nor <n>Styers<\n> testified to a plot in court.

No other witnesses or direct evidence linked <n>Milke<\n> to the crime other than <n>Saldate<\n>'s testimony.

<n>Saldate<\n> further said that <n>Milke<\n> confessed to her role in the murder plot during interrogation and said it was a "bad judgment call."

There was no recording of the interrogation, no one else was in the room or watching from a two-way mirror, and <n>Saldate<\n> said he threw away his notes shortly after completing his report.

<n>Milke<\n> offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had confessed to any role.

The trial became a he-said/she-said contest between the two.

Ultimately, the jury believed the detective and convicted <n>Milke<\n> of murder.

What prosecutors didn't tell the court was the detective's long history of lying under oath and misconduct.

<n>Saldate<\n> had been suspended five days for taking "liberties" with a female motorist and lying about it to his supervisors. Four confessions or indictments had been tossed out because <n>Saldate<\n> had lied under oath. Judges suppressed or vacated four other confessions because <n>Saldate<\n> had violated a person's constitutional rights.

In 2013, after more than 20 years in jail, an appeals court overturned <n>Milke<\n>'s conviction.

"The Constitution requires a fair trial," Chief Judge <n>Alex Kozinski<\n> of the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote. "This never happened in <n>Milke<\n>'s case."

"The state knew of the evidence in the personnel file and had an obligation to produce the documents," <n>Kozinski<\n> said. "... There can be no doubt that the state failed in its constitutional obligation."

<n>Milke<\n> was released on bail, and the court said she couldn't be tried again.

The state appealed the decision to the Arizona Supreme Court.

Last week, the Arizona Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. And on Monday, all charges against <n>Milke<\n> were finally dropped.

The ankle bracelet she had been wearing while on bail was removed. And <n>Milke<\n> left the court room, sobbing in relief.

The case is now closed. <n>Debra Milke<\n> is finally a free woman.
